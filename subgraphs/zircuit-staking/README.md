# Zircuit Staking Subgraph

## Methodology v1.0.0

LST and LRT protocols have successfully attracted users and significant Total Value Locked (TVL) as they were able to strike a balance between their relatively high yields, convenience and safety. Zircuit has partnered with leading LST and LRT protocols to provide users with boosted Zircuit rewards on top of native LST/LRT yields. Users stake a compatible asset into the Zircuit staking contract (on Ethereum mainnet) and immediately start earning Zircuit rewards, in addition to the underlying LST/LRT yields, while also helping to bootstrap Zircuitâ€™s liquidity.

Once the Zircuit L2 mainnet is live, there will be an opt-in migration process where depositors will be incentivized to move their assets staked on Ethereum mainnet onto the Zircuit L2 rollup.
